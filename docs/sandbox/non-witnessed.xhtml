         <h3>Grammatical Explanation</h3>
         
         <p>Turkic languages distinguish grammatically between events the agent saw
            with their own eyes, and events that were reported by someone else who is usually
            unspecified. Whereas languages such as English would accomplish this with an additional
            clause ("I heard that" or "they say that"), Central Asian Turkic and Persian achieve
            the
            same effect more succinctly with dedicated verbal modes. Whether or not the agent
            'heard' the information, learned from a report, or somehow otherwise intuited it,
            does
            not affect form of this construction: the dedicated grammatical forms are indicative
            of
            a categorical distinction in terms of the kind of information being conveyed.</p>
         
         <p>Not surprisingly, the non-witnessed mood is especially common in surviving
            historical official documents because the person writing the document (a scribe working
            in the central chancery) is generally not writing from firsthand experience.</p>
         
         <p>Central Asian Turki indicates that event was not witnessed in the present
            with ekan (ئىكەن) for the verb 'to be'. For
            instance: siz vafodor ekansiz: '(I have heard that) you are
            loyal.'</p>
         
         <p>The particle ekan / ئەكەن can
            also be paired with the perfect verbal adjective -gan (گەن / غان) to indicate hearsay about past
            action. For instance: bu kishi og'rini urgan ekan: 'this man hit
            the thief (but I did not see the event myself)'</p>
         
         <p>The -gan ekan construction is similar in meaning to
            the 'subjective past tense,' which conjoins the present -ip
            adverbial with the past tense verb 'to be'. For instance: poezd
            kelipti: '(I heard that) the train arrived'.</p>
         
         <p>Central Asian Persian incorporates this logic by combining the past
            participle (karda) + būda + the verb 'to be'. For instance: او را دیده
            بوده است: '(I) heard that he was seen.' There is a construction that has a
            similar meaning in the present tense, which makes it uncommon in historical texts
            (which
            generally describe something that happened in the past): می کرده
            است, '(s)he is (apparently) doing'.</p>
         
         <p>Unlike some of the other features of Central Asian Persian discussed in
            this book, the non-witnessded mode is not categorically absent in modern Iranian
            Persian: it is described in some grammar manuals and sometimes appears in modern media
            (though usually without the final است in کرده
            بوده است. However, this mode is more rarely used, and generally requires
            additional context to clarify the non-witnessed character of the action (e.g., appearing
            in narration). Moreover, the form is rarely attested with clear implications of
            non-witnessed action in classical texts.</p>
         
         <p>By contrast, the non-witness mode is ubiquitous in Central Asian Persian
            documents, in modern Tajik (both spoken and formal), and — importantly — does not
            require any additional context (e.g., 'I heard that...') to clarify that the action
            was
            non-witnessed.</p>

         <li>Uyghur: De Jong (pp. 108-110, ch. XIV) treats the -ipti construction as
            "subjective past tense," which is "used when the present relevance of an event or
            act in
            the past has to be stressed. It implies that the speaker's words are based on hearsay,
            and/or that the speaker has become aware of something unexpected."</li>
         
         <li>Central Asian Persian: Perry (pp. 227-234 offers the most complete
            discussion of this mode, and suggests the terminology "non-witnessed mode" we have
            adopted.</li>
         
         <li>Iranian Persian: Ḥasan Aḥmadī Gīvī (p. 459) describes this form as the
            'remote past' (māżī-yi abʿad) the speaker usually conveys the occurrence of action
            through a quotation and wants to highlight that they were absent and unaware of the
            event at the time of its occurrence but learned about it afterwards. Gīvī further
            clarifies that the concepts of witnessed and non-witnessed or awareness and unawareness
            are weak and understated in classical Persian texts.</li>
