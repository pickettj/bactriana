         <h3>Grammatical Explanation</h3>
         
         <p>Central Asian Turki and Persian share an 'uncertain present-future tense'
            or 'future participle' that expresses intentionality and probability, which is
            constructed simply by adding ī (ی) to the end of the infinative
            verb or -nī to the verb stem, depending on how you look at it: کردنی / карданӣ. The meaning is not quite "he
            <em>will</em>
            do something": it is closer to "he
            <em>intends</em>
            to do something" or "he
            <em>might</em>
            do something."</p>
         
         <p>Central Asian Persian also retains the present-future tense using the
            می / ме particle, which structurally
            indistinguishable from habitual action: می کند / мекунад can mean 'he is doing,' 'he will do,' or 'he (habitually) does'.
            However, this form (می کند) most often indicates
            <em>habitual</em>
            action when used in Central Asian Persian.</p>
         
         
         <p>This structural verb form (with the -ī appended to the infinitive) exists
            in Farsi (termed the "liyāqat" adjective), but occurs less commonly, and often with
            a
            different connotation. As in Central Asian Persian, these adjectives belong to the
            future tense category in terms of their aspectual modality. However, in practice this
            form tends to imply desirability or worthiness of action (hence liyāqat, lit.
            'worthiness') in the future, rather than intent or possibility: این فیلم دیدنی است,
            'this film is worth seeing'.</p>
         
         
         
         <p>Modern Iranian Persian also has dedicated future tense that implies
            greater certainy, which is present (though uncommon) in classical Persian, and unknown
            in Central Asian Persian (though used in modern Tajik): خواهد کرد
            / хоҳад кард</p>
         
         
         <p>Turkic languages have multiple ways of expressing future actions that imply
            either intentionality or indeterminancy. Two in particular, -ar and -maqchi, overlap
            with meanings of the -ani ending in Central Asian Persian.</p>
         
         <p>The uncertain present-future tense is expressed with an -ar ending attached
            to the verb stem in Turki. In Uzbek and Chaghatay, the ending is invariable: -ar and
            ار,
            respectively. In Uyghur, it can be either ەر or ار depending on whether the preceding
            consonant is voiced or unvoiced.</p>
         
         <p>There is also significant overlap with the -moqchi /
            ماقچى - مەكچى verbal mood in modern Uzbek and Uyghur, which
            designates the intention to do somethin gin the future. This verb form, however, is
            less
            common in pre-Soviet Turki texts, which makes the correspondence between -ar (Turki)
            and
            -anī (Central Asian Persian) perhaps closer. However, it the -moqchi is structurally the most similar to the -anī ending in Persian
            because both the -chi ending (in Uyghur / Uzbek) and the -ī ending (in Persian) can
            participalize the infinitive verb for an animate agent.</p>
         
         
         <p>Thus, the -anī ending helps the reader narrow down the intended meaning in
            Central Asian Persian: او به آنجا رفتنی است means that the action
            of 'going' is likely or intended to take place in the future, but that the outcome
            is
            not certain to take place (unlike خواهد رفت in modern Iranian
            Persian).</p>

                  <li>In this example, olmoqchi better approximates the intended meaning of the
                     Persian than olar because it emphasizes the intentionality of the action, rather
                     than the indeterminancy. However, olar is also a possible translations, and the
                     -moqchi ending would have been less likely in nineteenth-century Turki.</li>
                  
                  <li>This example was drawn from a bi-langual document (common for correspondence
                     between Bukharan and Russian colonial respective authorities), which means that
                     we know exactly how the colonial translator understood this construction:
                     Бухарское Правительство также хочет конфисковать, 'the Bukharan government also
                     wishes to confiscate...'</li>
                  
                  
                  <li>The 'hovli' is a type of Central Asian house with an open courtyard, and the
                     term is still used. Though it might be understood in Iran as well, it is here
                     translated to the more generic Farsi term for 'house' (خانه).</li>

                  <li>In Bukharan chancery orthography, the نی ending is often
                     separated from the verb (here برده نی instead of بردنی. This convention makes it easy to mistake this future
                     tense for a negated sentence (e.g., burda na-shudand, 'were not taken'). This
                     orthography may be evidence of the vernacular character of this construction,
                     i.e., the scribes transcribed the pronunciation of the verb form, rather than
                     reproducing a participle derived from the infinitive reproduced from the
                     literary tradition.</li>
                  
                  <li>Jura Bek Mirza is the grammatical subject of the first part of the sentence,
                     but not of the final verb (burdanī), which makes a succinct translation of the
                     passive veb form into English and Farsi wordier. We approximated the meaning
                     with "it was decided that" / قرار شد که, even though the
                     original does not necessarily state that a decision was made.</li>
                  
                  <li>Note that this scribe freely uses even Arabic conjunctions (مع, 'with'), a common practice in this kind of text.</li>
